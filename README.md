# Cash Register with Java

## Introduction
This was a simple Java exercise in creating classes and methods. The challenge was to create a Cash Register class that would use methods in the Calculator class to keep track of the money in the register. 

## Setup 
1. The command gradle init was used to create a new Java application
   ```JS
   gradle init
   ```
2. The selections were then entered:
   ```JS
   type: application
   lanuage: Java
   functionality: only one application
   build script DSL: Groovy
   test framework: JUnity 4
   ```

## Functionality
* The Cash Register holds multiple denominations of currency ($100, $50, $20, $10, $5, $1, $0.25, $0.10, $.05, and $0.01).
* The Cash Register allows money to be withdrawn.
* The Cash Register will create change using the the available quantities of bills or coins.
